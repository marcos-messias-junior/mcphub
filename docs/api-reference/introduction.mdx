The MCPHub API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to manage your MCP servers, groups, users, and more. The API is divided into two main categories:

- **MCP Endpoints**: These are the primary endpoints for interacting with your MCP servers. They provide a unified interface for sending requests to your servers and receiving responses in real-time.
- **Management API**: These endpoints are used for managing the MCPHub instance itself. This includes managing servers, groups, users, and system settings.

All API endpoints are available under the `/api` path. For example, the endpoint to get all servers is `/api/servers`.

Authentication is required for most Management API endpoints. See the [Authentication](/api-reference/auth) section for more details.
