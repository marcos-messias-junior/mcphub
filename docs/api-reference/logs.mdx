### Stream Logs

Streams logs in real-time using Server-Sent Events (SSE). The connection will remain open, and new log entries will be sent as they occur.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/logs/stream`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Response Format**: The stream sends events with a `data` field containing a JSON object. The first event has `type: 'initial'` and contains all historical logs. Subsequent events have `type: 'log'` and contain a single new log entry.

- **Example Event**:
  ```
  data: {"type":"log","log":{"timestamp":"2023-10-27T10:00:05.000Z","level":"debug","message":"Processing request for /api/some-endpoint","service":"mcp-server"}}
  ```
